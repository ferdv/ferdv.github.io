My main research interests are:

* Semantics of programming languages (mostly of the structural operational flavour)
* Functional programming
* Program transformation
* Interactive theorem provers (currently a Coq user, previously Isabelle/HOL)
* Compiler design and implementation; code generation
* Operational equivalence of programs, bisimulation and congruence formats

Other interests include logic, proof theory, programming & software engineering, operating systems and their history (esp. Unix), and "[retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing)".
