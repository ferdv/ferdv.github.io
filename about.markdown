I am a computer science educator and researcher. I work as a lecturer at the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) of [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). Previously, I was a tutor in the <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/">Swansea University</a> and, before that, a postdoc in the <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a>, where I was a part of the Siriusly group.

I completed my PhD at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Peter D. Mosses](https://pdmosses.github.io/).
