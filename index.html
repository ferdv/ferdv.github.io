<p><em>Ferdinand</em> here. I am a teacher and researcher in computer science. I work as a tutor in the <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/">Swansea University</a>. My interests (research and otherwise) mainly involve programming languages, interactive theorem proving, compilers, and operating systems.</p>

<p>I enjoy programming. My current primary language is <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.</p>
